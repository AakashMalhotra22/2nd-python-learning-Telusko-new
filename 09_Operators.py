#1. Arithmetic Operators:
#In this mathematics operations such as addition, sub, division and all the other function in mathematics.
# Example:


x = 3
y=3
print(x+y)

from math import*

print(sqrt(3))
print(round(3.5658764565456546))


#2.Assignment

'''Assignment
x=2 is the example of assignment in which 2 is assigned to x.

'''
x =3
print(x)

x = x+3
print(x)

#Increament

x += 2
print(x)

x *=3
print(x)

a,b = 5,6

print(a,b)
print(a)

#Unary Operators:

n = 7
print(n)

print(-n)

n = -n

print(n)

#Relational Operations
#Comparison

a =5
b = 6
print(a<b)
print(a>b)
print(a==b)
print(a<=b)
print(a>=b)

print(a!=b)

#Logical Operators
# and or not

c = 5
d = 9

print(c<8 and d <10)

print(c<8 and d<7)
print(c<10 or d <6)
#Study the truth table of "and" gate and of "or" gate.

x = True
print(x)

print(not x)

x = not x
print(x)
