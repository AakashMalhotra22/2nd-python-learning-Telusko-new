'''
There are eight datatype in python:
1. String
2. List
3. Tuples
4. Set
5. Dictionary/Map
6. None
7. Numeric
8. Range
'''

#1. None: When you have a variable in python and it is not assigned with any values, it is none, in other languages we use null.
# For example:

m = [2, 3]
print(m.append("ram"))

#2.Numeric:
'''
There are four type of numeric:
1. int
2. float
3. complex
4. bool
'''
#1. Integer: Which means the integers numbers in which no decimal number comes.

int = 3
print(type(int))
#2 float: This means float decimal interpretation in which all decimal places comes. in this you will get 2.0 insted of 2
float = 3.5
print(type(float))

#Complex: This Means complex numbers in which j repersents iota, not i.

complex = 3+4j
print(type(complex))

print((3+4j)*(3+4j))

#4. bool means bullein type , true or false

n =13
m =14
print(n<m)

#In python, true means 1 and 0 means false, if convert true in integer you will get 1 and if you covert false in int, you will get 0.


'''
list, tuple, sets, string, range comes under sequence.

'''

# 3. List, Tuple, sets, str

list = [3,4]
print(type(list))

s ={3, 4 , 98, 4}
print(s)
print(type(s))

str = "navin"
print(str)
print(type(str))

tuple = (3,4,5)
print(tuple)

print(type(tuple))





















#character in python : means each part of string, for example r = "ram", so it has three character r, a and m.
